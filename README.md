Description:

The idea is to create a simplified reddit-like app(no authentication, etc) using an _embedded_ tech stack. The purpose is to explore Angular 2 together with a Java
server environment, without having to install external software such as tomcat, mysql, etc.

* Java
* Embedded Jetty
* H2 database (Embedded)
* RESTful API using Spring
* Hibernate
* Angular 2
* TypeScript (to be used along with Angular 2)
* Node.js (for management of frontend dependencies)
