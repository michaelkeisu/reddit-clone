Description:

The idea is to create a simplified reddit-clone using an embedded tech stack. The purpose isn't
to create something that scales well, but rather just to explore different tecnhologies/frameworks(such as Angular 2) without having
to install external software such as tomcat, mysql, etc.

* Java
* Embedded Jetty
* H2 (Embedded)
